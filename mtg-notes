Meta-analysis Meeting Notes 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


Something perhaps 90 percent of people don't know about statistics.

For an interaction (.30), what's that coefficient mean? (Beyond just the "association of interaction on outcome variable").

First, you designate which is focal predictor and which is moderator. It is the amount of change that occurs on the slope for the focal predictor for every one unit of change on the moderator variable.

For example, Org. Comm. scale 1-50 (focal pred) and income (moderator) on turnover cognitions (outcome variable).

It's telling you income changes by .30 for every unit change of focal pred.

Ongoing List of Possible Study Characteristics
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Particular gaming element (design characteristics)
	   Leadership board, points, levels (some of these can fall in various Bedwell gaming element categories, but we are not going to use Bedwell's attributes)

Gamifiying something that did not work/worked

What is the occupation/workplace setting?
     Research, academic, training, recruitment, construction

What DV do we seek to improve?
     Engagement, performance, motivation, user experience (Landers, 2014 gam. theory)

What is the specific application domain?
     Training, recruitment, service marketing (Landers, 2014 g.th), education.

Employee characterisitcs
	Personality
	Age
	Job Tenure
	gender

Company focus, whether external (customers, vendors involved, etc.) or internal (training, recruitment, etc.)?

Is it peer-reviewed or non-peer reviewed?
	Are the researchers from a private company that stands to gain from positive results? 
	
Creates/encourages competition (social experience)?



Outcomes: proximal or distal (Landers, 2014)







\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
We expect there will be an effect, but it will be heterogeneous (some areas effective, others not).

Gamification Theory by Landers


Ben is curious if this gamification is above and beyond feedback, or if feedback is the confound. As a study, you would want one group with no feedback, one group with gamified feedback, one group with only feedback.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
For next time, we start with: Landers

gamification  (e.g.,  points,  levels,  badges)  may  help  in  some  learning  contexts,  but  
harm in others. Current theoretical models do not provide a mechanism by which to 
explore why this might occur for these or any other game elements.

Added (Bedwell et al, 2012) reference in above possible study char. section
Added to References doc
Removed Bedwell et al 2012 after further consideration

For next meeting, we start at page 9 (should be Monday, June 19) on Landers Theory of Gamification article, Table 2. Start reading from, "Theory of Gamified Learning".

One thing Dr. M came up with... if you can imagine what it would be like without the game element, it's gamification. If you can't (the whole thing is a game), then it's a game and not gamification.
"Gamification is where you tack on a gaming element to an already existing process, as opposed to it being the entire process.

Brief discussion about Gamification on May 31, 2017 @ 7:00 pm
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Gamification is something from the game world (characteristics) to improve a non-game. The user experiences it as a non-game before and after gamification.
It's an important distinction.

Common to see studies with comparison across two groups. One has no gamified model, the other does not.
